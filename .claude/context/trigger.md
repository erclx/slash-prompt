# Trigger detection

## Overview

Owns per-site trigger-symbol activation and keyboard navigation in the content script. The content script watches each target site's chat input for the configured trigger symbol and opens the dropdown when activation conditions match.

## Layout

- `src/content/input/` owns the detector, per-site adapters, and the site observer

Also uses `src/content/hooks/use-input-detection.ts`.

## Default symbol: `>`

Claude.ai natively intercepts `/` for its own command menu. Using `>` by default avoids DOM race conditions. Users can override per site in options.

`/` is not blocked as a trigger value. If a user saves `/` for `claude.ai` or `chatgpt.com`, `site-config-section.tsx` shows an amber warning immediately on load and while the value is active. The warning is non-blocking: the user can still save. Gemini has no native slash command, so no warning is shown there.

## Word boundary rule

The trigger symbol only fires when it appears at position 0 in the input, or is immediately preceded by whitespace. Typing a symbol mid-word (e.g. `word>`) must not open the dropdown. Detection checks the character at `cursorPosition - 1` before activating.

## Per-site input adapters

Each target site renders its chat input differently:

- Claude.ai: contenteditable div (ProseMirror)
- Gemini: contenteditable div
- ChatGPT: contenteditable div (also ProseMirror-based)

Insertion uses `document.execCommand('insertText')` which triggers framework synthetic events on all three. Abstracted behind an input adapter per site (`adapters.ts`).

The contenteditable adapter maintains two text representations. Cursor position uses raw text content offsets so the insertion path can map positions back to DOM nodes. Text-before-cursor uses rendered range text so trigger validation sees newlines at block boundaries. Browsers omit the trailing newline when a range ends at the start of a block element, so the adapter detects block boundaries and injects the missing newline.

## Keyboard navigation

- ↑↓, Ctrl+J / Cmd+J (down), Ctrl+P / Cmd+P (up) navigate. Both `ctrlKey` and `metaKey` are accepted so Mac users can use the native modifier.
- Enter or Tab inserts. Escape dismisses.
- Ctrl+K and Ctrl+N are intentionally excluded. Ctrl+K conflicts with Claude.ai's native formatting shortcut.
- Handled via keydown listener on window (capture phase) to intercept before host page handlers fire.

## Risks

- Claude.ai uses ProseMirror. `execCommand` still triggers its synthetic events today, but a future ProseMirror release could break that path and force the adapter to dispatch a custom transaction instead.
- ChatGPT DOM structure changes frequently. Content script selector targeting is fragile and lives in `site-observer.ts`.
